There are more than 150 color-space conversion methods available in OpenCV. But we will look into only two which are most 
widely used ones, BGR -> Gray and BGR -> HSV.

For color conversion, we use the function cv2.cvtColor(input_image, flag) where flag determines the type of conversion.

For BGR -> Gray conversion we use the flags cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY. Similarly for BGR -> HSV, we use the flag cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV. 
To get other flags, just run following commands in your Python terminal:
'''

# Declare libraries
import cv2 
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import sys


flags = [i for i in dir(cv2) if i.startswith('COLOR_')]
print(flags)

'''
Note: For HSV, Hue range is [0,179], Saturation range is [0,255] and Value range is [0,255]. Different softwares use different 
scales. So if you are comparing OpenCV values with them, you need to normalize these ranges.

Object Tracking
Now we know how to convert BGR image to HSV, we can use this to extract a colored object. In HSV, it is more easier to 
represent a color than RGB color-space. In our application, we will try to extract a blue colored object. So here is the 
method:

1. Take each frame of the video
2. Convert from BGR to HSV color-space
3. We threshold the HSV image for a range of blue color
4. Now extract the blue object alone, we can do whatever on that image we want.

Below is the code which are commented in detail :
'''
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

while(1):

    # Take each frame
    _, frame = cap.read()

    # Convert BGR to HSV
    hsv = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV)

    # define range of blue color in HSV
    lower_blue = np.array([110,50,50])
    upper_blue = np.array([130,255,255])

    # Threshold the HSV image to get only blue colors
    mask = cv2.inRange(hsv, lower_blue, upper_blue)

    # Bitwise-AND mask and original image
    res = cv2.bitwise_and(frame,frame, mask= mask)

    cv2.imshow('frame',frame)
    cv2.imshow('mask',mask)
    cv2.imshow('res',res)
    k = cv2.waitKey(5) & 0xFF
    if k == 27:
        break

cv2.destroyAllWindows()

'''
Here we Mask the image or make the color of interest which is blue as white color and the set all other as black color.
What the bitwise_and() do is add the original image with the mask image. 

Remember that using bitwise_and(), WHITE + ANYCOLOR = ANYCOLOR
and BLACK + ANYCOLOR = BLACK.

So we We can see that the result image is all black except for the image of interest!

How to find HSV values to track?
This is a common question found in stackoverflow.com. It is very simple and you can use the same function, cv2.cvtColor(). 
Instead of passing an image, you just pass the BGR values you want. For example, to find the HSV value of Green, try following 
commands in Python terminal:
'''

green = np.uint8([[[0,255,0 ]]])
hsv_green = cv2.cvtColor(green,cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV)
print hsv_green
Output = [60 255 255]

'''
Now you take [H-10, 100,100] and [H+10, 255, 255] as lower bound and upper bound respectively. Apart from this method, you can
use any image editing tools like GIMP or any online converters to find these values, but donâ€™t forget to adjust the HSV ranges.
